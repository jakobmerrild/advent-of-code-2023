# advent-of-code-base
This repository contains my base for solving [advent-of-code](https://adventofcode.com/).

The repository uses Scala 3

## How to run
You can run the app via `sbt`
```
sbt run solve <day>
```

Optionally you can provide the path to a different input
```
sbt run solve <day> --path <pathToInput>
```
